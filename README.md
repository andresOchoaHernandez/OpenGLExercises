# OpenGL Exercises
This repository contains the code for all the OpenGL exercises required for the masters degree's graphics programming course at UniVr.

# GLAD PACKAGE
Glad has been downloaded from the official [web service](https://glad.dav1d.de/) and put in the folder `lib/glad` as a submodule. Then a CMakeLists.txt was placed to compile it as a shared library that will be linked to the `main.cpp`.
